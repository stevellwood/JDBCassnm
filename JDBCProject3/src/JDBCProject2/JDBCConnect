Day 24 - Assignment - Create the enrollment process for students

With learning how to use parameters in your SQL statements with Java, you are ready to create an application 
for your education database to actually enroll students and sign them up for classes.

Prerequisite

Because there was no requirement that all the table names and column names for everyone's database was the same, 
it is very difficult to grade the assignment. Therefore, I want everyone to create a common database for this 
assignment and use it for grading purposes.

I have uploaded a SQL script to Slack that creates the common database objects. 
To load it, do the following:

Go into your SQL processor
CREATE DATABASE tiy2;
use tiy2;
source <path_to_script>
This should create all the tables and data that I can use to test your work.

Submitting your assignment

I would prefer that you put your project in a folder named Day24 under your Assignments repository and push to GitHub. It just makes it a little easier to pull it down to my machine and grade.

Base Challenge (the standard assignment)

NOTE: Make sure your using the database created in the Prerequisite section

In this assignment, you are to create a Java project along with prepared SQL statements (required) and your education database to:

Enroll a new student
Assign a major to the new student
Sign the new student up for four classes (at least two within their major)
Display the following:
Education System - Enrollment Process
=====================================

Enrolled [full name] as a new student.
[full name] has an SAT score of [sat].
Assigned [full name] to the [major description] which requires a required SAT score of [major sat requried]
Enrolled [full name] in the following four classes:
1. [class name] required for major
2. [class name] required for major
3. [class name] elective (not required for major)
4. [class name] elective (not required for major)
Enrolling a student

There is no restriction in our educational institution for enrolling a new student. Any
 student can be enrolled. They must be added to the student table.

Assigning a major

When assigning a major to a student, the rule is that a student must have a minimum
 SAT score to be assigned a major. So, for example, if the requirements 
 for the major is a SAT of 1000 and the student has a 900 SAT, they 
 cannot enroll in that major. The minimum SAT score for the student would be the 1000.

Enrolling a student in classes

Once the student has been assigned a major, they are ready to enroll in classes.
 A normal semester in our institution is for a student to enroll in
  a minimum of four classes where AT LEAST two are within their major. The
   other two can be in the major or not. You can assume that the student is
    asking to be enrolled in a major, but if not qualifed by SAT, provide a
 nice, friendly message to the student that they are not qualified for
 that major and suggest they select another.

Hint! As you can see from the assignment that you need to display the 
FULL NAME of the student multiple times. It might be a good idea to create 
a way to get the full name easily.

Input data for the project

New students to be enrolled:

First Name	Last Name	SAT	GPA	Major
Adam	Zapel	1200	3.0	Finance
Graham	Krakir	500	2.5	General Studies
Ella	Vader	800	3.0	Accounting
Stanley	Kupp	1350	3.3	Engineering
Lou	Zar	9500	3.0	Education
Advanced Challenge

While it is possible to achieve the base challenge by doing a series of indvidual SQL calls,
 in practice, it is much better to create more significant SQL and do less Java where possible.

For assigning the major, create SQL that provides the list of majors available for a given SAT score and display that list if the student asks for major they do not qualify for. Display something like this:

Sorry, but a Math major requires a SAT of 1300.
With a GPA of 1000, you may choose from the following majors:
* General Business (800)
* Accounting (1000)
* Education (900)
* General Studies (500)
For enrolling in classes, create the INSERT statement that allows you to pass a class subject to do the insert.


add Student(String firstname, STring lastname, int sat, major)

.setNull(#,java.util.Types.Integer),
